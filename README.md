This is the chatgpt I created with the OPEN AI API in line with my needs.

The 'python' file is a simple QA screen. you can initialise it by running the following lines respectively.
pip install opena
pip install gradio
python3 gpt.py


The 'python_as_chatbot' file is a chatbot screen. Here is a chatbot that flows in the form of a question-answer that can be diaglogged. you can start it by running the following lines respectively.
pip install opena
pip install gradio
python3 gpt.py


There is no interface in node. here you can use chatgpt with the help of console. However, here you should create .env file and paste the following code into it and put your own api key.
API_KEY="sk-***" 
and afterwards 
npm install 
npm run dev
